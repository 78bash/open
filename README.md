# open
Open is a global community activity aimed at providing world-class presentation material for presenters who want to evangelise or promote the Open Source way of work.

Whether your project is software, hardware, or even any creative endeavour (such as Open) you will find here a primer on, not only how Open Source licensing protects you better, but also how it makes the world a better place.

See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=voOmavJmQpw&t) a recorded example of how Open can be presented to a live audience.
